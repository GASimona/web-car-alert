    <h1>
        Privacy Policy
    </h1>
    <p>This privacy policy has been compiled to better serve those who are concerned with how their 'Personally Identifiable
        Information' (PII) is being used online. PII, as described in US privacy law and information security, is information
        that can be used on its own or with other information to identify, contact, or locate a single person, or to identify
        an individual in context. Please read our privacy policy carefully to get a clear understanding of how we collect,
        use, protect or otherwise handle your Personally Identifiable Information in accordance with our website.</p>

    <h2>What personal information do we collect from the people that us our app?</h2>
    <p>When using our app, as appropriate, we collect when some papers expire for your car and when you need to perform checks on your car. This information is not sent on the internet and does not leave your phone.</p>

    <h2>When do we collect information?</h2>
    <p>We collect information from you when you fill in the expiration dates.</p>

    <h2>How do we use your information?</h2>
    <p>We use that information only to notificate you when the configured date is near.
    </p>

    <h2>How do we protect your information?</h2>
    <p>The aplication only stores data locally and it never leaves from your phone. All information is stored using the internal storage of the specific platform.</p>

    <h2>Do we use 'cookies'?</h2>
    <p>We do not use cookies at all.</p>

    <h2>Third-party disclosure</h2>
    <p>We do not sell, trade, or otherwise transfer to outside parties your Personally Identifiable Information unless we provide
        users with advance notice. This does not include website hosting partners and other parties who assist us in operating
        our website, conducting our business, or serving our users, so long as those parties agree to keep this information
        confidential. We may also release information when it's release is appropriate to comply with the law, enforce our
        site policies, or protect ours or others' rights, property or safety. However, non-personally identifiable visitor
        information may be provided to other parties for marketing, advertising, or other uses.</p>

    <h2>Third-party links</h2>
    <p>We do not include or offer third-party products or services on our website.</p>

    <h2>California Online Privacy Protection Act</h2>
    <p>CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy policy.
        The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States (and conceivably
        the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California consumers to post
        a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected and those individuals
        or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf</p>

    <h2>According to CalOPPA, we agree to the following:</h2>
    <p>Users can visit our site anonymously. Once this privacy policy is created, we will add a link to it on our home page
        or as a minimum, on the first significant page after entering our website. Our Privacy Policy link includes the word
        'Privacy' and can easily be found on the page specified above. You will be notified of any Privacy Policy changes:
        <bl>
            <li>On our Privacy Policy Page Can change your personal information</li>
        </bl>
    </p>

    <h2>How does our site handle Do Not Track signals?</h2>
    <p>We honor Do Not Track signals and Do Not Track, plant cookies, or use advertising when a Do Not Track (DNT) browser mechanism
        is in place.</p>

    <h2>Does our site allow third-party behavioral tracking?</h2>
    <p>It's also important to note that we do not allow third-party behavioral tracking</p>

    <h2>COPPA (Children Online Privacy Protection Act)</h2>
    <p>When it comes to the collection of personal information from children under the age of 13 years old, the Children's Online
        Privacy Protection Act (COPPA) puts parents in control. The Federal Trade Commission, United States' consumer protection
        agency, enforces the COPPA Rule, which spells out what operators of websites and online services must do to protect
        children's privacy and safety online. We do not specifically market to children under the age of 13 years old. Do
        we let third-parties, including ad networks or plug-ins collect PII from children under 13?</p>

    <h2>Fair Information Practices</h2>
    <p>The Fair Information Practices Principles form the backbone of privacy law in the United States and the concepts they
        include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding
        the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
        privacy laws that protect personal information.</p>

    <h2>In order to be in line with Fair Information Practices we will take the following responsive action, should a data breach
        occur:
    </h2>
    <p>Since the data never leaves the users phone we do not collect data in a single place where it can be stolen. If a break happens, it is directly on a users phone and we cannot be aware of it.</p>

    <h2>Removal of user data</h2>
    <p>In case the user decides he wants us to completely remove all data associated with his app, he can just uninstall the app and all data will be gone.

    <h2>Other information related to privacy</h2>
    <p>For any other information or questions related to the privacy, the users can contact us at
        <a href="mailto:gorneanusimona@gmail.com">gorneanusimona@gmail.com</a>
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top: 50px;">We also agree to the Individual Redress Principle which requires that individuals have the right to legally pursue enforceable
        rights against data collectors and processors who fail to adhere to the law. This principle requires not only that
        individuals have enforceable rights against data users, but also that individuals have recourse to courts or government
        agencies to investigate and/or prosecute non-compliance by data processors.</p>
